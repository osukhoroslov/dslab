# FaaS scheduling experiment
This example evaluates different approaches for scheduling of function invocations (several simple strategies and [Hermes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07226) scheduler) on Azure functions dataset.
## Running experiment
- download and unpack Azure functions [dataset](https://github.com/Azure/AzurePublicDataset/blob/master/AzureFunctionsDataset2019.md)
- build
- run `faas-scheduling-experiment %path_to_dataset%`

It is recommended to build strictly in release mode and leave only one day out of 14 since the dataset is really large.
Note that the last two days in the dataset have no memory percentiles. Such days are ignored.
