# DSLab Network

A library for modeling network communications. It can be easily plugged in simulations based on DSLab core by defining 
network nodes and binding the simulation components to the nodes. After that, using the library one can simulate data 
transfers or messaging between the components. The library includes several ready-to-use network models and allows to 
use it with custom model implementations.
