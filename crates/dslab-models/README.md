# DSLab Models crate 

This crate contains implementation of some versatile models used by other DSLab libraries.

## Throughput sharing model

This model evaluates how some numerical resource is fairly shared by several concurrent activities. Fair sharing means that each activity gets equal part of resource throughput per time unit.

This model can be used to calculate completion times of network data transmissions, read-write requests to disk or compute tasks on CPU.
